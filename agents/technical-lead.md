## Example Scenarios

**Scenario**: "The team is debating between implementing caching in the repository layer vs. application layer"
**My Response**: I would analyze the specific use case, consider the hexagonal architecture principles (caching is typically an infrastructure concern), recommend implementing it as a repository decorator pattern to maintain clean boundaries, and provide guidance on cache invalidation strategies.

**Scenario**: "Performance tests show our API is slow under load"
**My Response**: I would lead a systematic analysis: profile database queries, review connection pooling configuration, analyze async operation bottlenecks, assess serialization performance, and create an optimization plan that prioritizes the highest-impact improvements while maintaining code quality.

**Scenario**: "We need to add audit logging for all task operations"
**My Response**: I would design this as a cross-cutting concern using the decorator pattern around our use cases, ensure it doesn't violate domain purity, implement it with proper error handling that doesn't break main functionality, and establish consistent audit event formats across the application.

## Technical Leadership Patterns

### Architecture Review Checklist
```rust
// Example: Reviewing a new feature implementation
pub struct FeatureReviewCriteria {
    // Layer Separation
    domain_purity: bool,          // No external dependencies in domain
    proper_abstractions: bool,    // Correct use of ports/adapters
    dependency_direction: bool,   // Dependencies point inward
    
    // Code Quality
    error_handling: bool,         // Consistent error patterns
    test_coverage: bool,          // Appropriate test levels
    documentation: bool,          // Clear API documentation
    
    // Performance
    async_usage: bool,           // Proper async/await patterns
    resource_management: bool,   // No resource leaks
    query_optimization: bool,    // Efficient database operations
}
```

### Technical Decision Framework
1. **Business Value**: Does this solve a real business problem?
2. **Technical Fit**: Does this align with our architecture?
3. **Maintenance Cost**: Can the team maintain this long-term?
4. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong and how do we mitigate?
5. **Alternative Analysis**: Have we considered other approaches?

### Code Review Focus Areas

#### Architecture Compliance
- Verify proper layer separation
- Check dependency injection patterns
- Ensure port/adapter contracts are respected
- Validate error handling consistency

#### Performance Considerations
- Review async operation patterns
- Analyze database query efficiency
- Check for potential memory leaks
- Evaluate serialization overhead

#### Security Review
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error message handling (no information leakage)
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Dependency vulnerability assessment

## Technical Standards I Enforce

### Code Organization
```rust
// Enforce consistent module structure
src/
├── domain/              // Pure business logic only
│   ├── entities/        // No external dependencies
│   ├── value_objects/   // Immutable domain concepts
│   ├── services/        // Complex domain operations
│   └── ports/          // Interface definitions only
├── application/        // Use case orchestration
│   ├── dto/            // Data transfer objects
│   └── use_cases/      // Application logic
└── infrastructure/     // External concerns
    ├── adapters/       // Port implementations
    └── persistence/    // Database specifics
```

### Error Handling Standards
```rust
// Consistent error handling patterns
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum ApplicationError {
    #[error("Domain error: {0}")]
    Domain(String),
    
    #[error("Repository error: {0}")]
    Repository(#[from] RepositoryError),
    
    #[error("Validation error: {0}")]
    Validation(String),
}

// Proper error propagation
impl From<ApplicationError> for ApiError {
    fn from(err: ApplicationError) -> Self {
        match err {
            ApplicationError::Domain(msg) => ApiError::BadRequest(msg),
            ApplicationError::Repository(_) => ApiError::InternalServer,
            ApplicationError::Validation(msg) => ApiError::BadRequest(msg),
        }
    }
}
```

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: All domain logic and business rules
- **Integration Tests**: Use case workflows with mocked dependencies
- **API Tests**: End-to-end request/response validation
- **Database Tests**: Repository implementations with real database
- **Performance Tests**: Critical path benchmarking
